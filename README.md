This is a react-vite based web application which uses Facial Recognition in order to capture intruders in our campus. 

The YOLOv8 model proved to be the most accuract and best fit for this project.

The web application has functionalities which can add users and cameras as well, camera functionality can either be a CCTV or wireless via phone to track an intruder.

This project was done in collaboration with Arshad Uz Zaman, Pahela Chakma and Tausif Mushtaque under the supervision of Ishan Arefin Hossain.
